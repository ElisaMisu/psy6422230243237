# Visualizing Identity: A Study of Sexual Orientation and Religion Across England and Wales

## Data

The data for this project was downloaded from the Office for National Statistics website (link in references). The original file ( which can be found in the GitHub repository's data file) includes the code book and metadata on sheets on the corresponding sheets.

The data was a product of the 2021 census â€“ the sheets downloaded contained other demographic data that were collected alongside sexual orientation at the point of the census including: age, sex, employment status, smoking habits and general health.

## Research question

The decision to focus on religion and sexual orientation came after a recent discussion that ensued after sharing religious school experiences with friends and colleagues. The question being that, even if one found themselves of a sexual orientation that was deemed anathema by their church/religion, would they still identify with that religion? (which inevitably led to many other questions, outlined below under follow-up) Some churches and religious branches are now very progressive, but a religion, in its very nature, cannot be. Before scrolling through the ONS website I proposed that the data would represent this with a higher percentage of LGBTQIA+ groups identifying as not religious than the heterosexual population.
