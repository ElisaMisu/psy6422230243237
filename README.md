## Project Title: Visualizing Identity: A Study of Sexual Orientation and Religion Across England and Wales

### Project Description 

This is the repository for a data visualisation project submitted towards a MSc degree at the University of Sheffield. The project aims to explore the relationship between sexual orientation and religion across England and Wales. The project uses data from the 2021 ONS consensus to create a visualisation that explores the relationship between sexual orientation and religion. The project uses a range of RStudio packages including tidyverse, scales and plotly. The final visualisation is interactive and allows users to explore the data in more detail.
