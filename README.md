## Visualizing Identity: A Study of Sexual Orientation and Religion Across England and Wales

### Project Description 

This is the repository for a data visualisation project submitted towards a MSc degree at the University of Sheffield. The project aims to explore the relationship between sexual orientation and religion across England and Wales. The project utilises 2021 ONS census data, along with RStudio packages 'tidyverse', 'scales', and 'plotly', to create an interactive visualisation exploring the intersection of sexual orientation and religious identity.
